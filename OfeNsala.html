                <div class = "description">Ofe Nsala is a delicacy peculiar to the Igbo tribe of Nigeria, especially the people of Anambra state. Ofe Nsala is known as white soup because palm oil is not used for the preparation, unlike other traditional soups. While it is traditionally made with catfish, one can also make use of chicken or turkey.

                            <li>Usually when you buy catfish in Nigerian markets, the sellers will kill and cut it up for you.</li>
                            <li>When you get home, boil hot water and pour on the pieces of fish to remove the slime on the fish as well as toughen them. You want to toughen the catfish so it does not disintegrate in the soup.</li>
                            <li>Quickly rinse off the slime with cool water and place the fish in the cooking pot.</li>
                            <li>Peel the yam and cut into medium pieces.</li>
                            <li>Chop the utazi and pound in a mortar with the pepper, ogiri okpei and crayfish. Just give them a rough pound. Same with if you are using a blender.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Add the seasoning cubes (crushed) to the pot of fish.</li>
                            <li>Add the pieces of yam.</li>
                            <li>Pour water to cover everything and start cooking.</li>
                            <li>When the yam is soft and moist, bring them out and place in a mortar.</li>
                            <li>Add the pounded crayfish, pepper, ogiri okpei and utazi into the pot of fish and continue cooking.</li>
                            <li>Pound the cooked yam in a mortar till smooth and stretchy.</li>
                            <li>Add the yam into the pot of Ofe Nsala in small lumps, cover and continue cooking.</li>
                            <li>Once the yam dissolves and thickens the soup, it is done. If you achieve medium consistency before all the yam is dissolved, take out the undissolved yam because you do not want the Ofe Nsala to be too thick.</li>
                            <li>Add salt if necessary, stir very well and thatâ€™s it!</li>
